TagMan for Django
=================

A django tagging app that, unlike taggit and django-tagging, does not implement free-form
tagging but focuses on more curated tags that can be added to any model.

Functionality also for 'system' tags that do not appear in M2M widgets by default so
users cannot add them directly to objects, but they will be added automatically on the fly.
